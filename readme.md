**Infinite canvas** is an infinite canvas _(thanks you captain obvious)_ where you can only draw lines that link edges of the grid.


## Runing 

You can use the app by opening the `index.html` in your browser

You can run it in a node.js serveur with :

node app.js
```
and access at your [localhost](http://localhost:3000*

Or you can use :

You need to install all dependencies with
